# The Real Estate project
 This project is to practice my JavaScript filtering skills, rendering to DOM, using Local Storage and practicing Webpack. I mainly took as an inspiration https://www.funda.nl because they have very broad options to filter and sort results. I thought it would be a nice challenge.
